#Saycel Uptime Monitor
This code builds the API to monitor the wide area network uptime of our Pearl Lagoon Cellular Network.  It is still under development.  However API routes are now available to query to see historical and currâ€ ent data in formatted JSON.  For now here is an IP Address - Port && api-routes that you can query to see our pingtimes. Soon we will use a domain. 

Currently we ping our system every thirty minutes.  This will increase.
